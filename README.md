# User guide
In order to use our implementation of the drone you need to follow these steps:
1. add our repo link in your `Cargo.toml` file under the `[dependencies]` section. It should look something like this:
```rust
[dependencies]
TrustDrone = {git = "https://github.com/Beto-prog/TrustDrone.git", features = ["serialize","debug"]}
```
2. Pray God (**and Rust**) it works
