# User guide
In order to use our implementation of the drone you need to follow these steps:
1. Add our repo link in your `Cargo.toml` file under the `[dependencies]` section. It should look something like this:
```rust
[dependencies]
TrustDrone = { git = "https://github.com/Beto-prog/TrustDone", package = "drone" }
```
2. Pray God (and Rust, or both) it works
3. If the previous step didn't work, feel free to write us on this Telegram group
